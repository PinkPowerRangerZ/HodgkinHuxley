# HodgkinHuxley
Bifurcation refers to a qualitative change in the behavior of a dynamic system due to parameter variation, with implications for various physical, biological, and engineering systems. This work presents a parallel algorithm for generating the bifurcation diagram of the Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model, a mathematical model used to understand neural networks and action potentials in neurons.
